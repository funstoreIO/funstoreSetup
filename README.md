# funstore

Funstore makes it  easy for people to start using Internet of things devices, services and platforms. It enables them to quickly install, or create, or share applications on all smart things.

Currently it supports Raspberry Pi 2 and Grove Pi and will be supporting other platforms soon. It supports applications built on python and Wolfram Language. Support for other languages, devices and platforms in planned for future release.

## Get Started in Minutes
You can onboard your IoT platforms, boards and services on funstore and start using our existing IoT applications or you can even build your own. Itâ€™s really as simple as installing apps on your smartphones.

## Maker And Developer Friendly
Funstore supports numerous languages and frameworks including C++, Python, Node.js, PHP, Wolfram language, visual programming and many more. You can use our simple IoT Toolkit for easy integration, automation and testing to create automation rules using any devices or services you like, whether it's for Raspberry Pi, Arduino, Intel Edison, Beaglebone Black, REST/pubsub API's or a custom protocol.

## API support
Funstore makes it easy for companies to design thier IoTs using REST API for early adopters in minutes. This helps their users to quickly onboard on their platform and get an idea of their services beforehand.
